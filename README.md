# Economics Research Project

This repository contains computational economics research focused on sovereign debt and default modeling.

## Overview

The project includes theoretical and empirical analysis of debt dynamics, featuring:

- Mathematical modeling of default decisions
- Numerical simulations and calibration
- Data analysis and visualization
- Academic paper documentation

## Structure

- `baseline_info/` - Core model implementations
- `full_info/` - Complete information scenarios
- `long_term/` - Extended analysis and empirical work
- `paper/` - Academic documentation and LaTeX files
- `Result/` - Generated figures and output
- `scripts/` - Utility and visualization scripts

## Requirements

- Julia for computational modeling
- MATLAB for data processing
- LaTeX for document compilation
- Fortran compiler for numerical routines

## Usage

Individual components can be run independently. See specific directories for detailed implementation.
