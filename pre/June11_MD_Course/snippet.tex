\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Contribution: A New Mechanism for Sovereign Default}\\
    I introduce a tractable sovereign default model with \textbf{heterogeneous lender beliefs}, where the market consists of both rational and boundedly rational agents.

    \item \textbf{Theoretical Result: Endogenous "Price Cliff"}\\
    This mechanism endogenously generates a \textbf{discontinuous bond price schedule}. This provides a new theoretical foundation for understanding sudden stops and financial crises.

    \item \textbf{Quantitative Success: Resolving the Spread Puzzles}\\
    When calibrated, the model can match the \textbf{high average spreads} observed in emerging markets. Crucially, it then endogenously produces \textbf{extreme spread volatility}, resolving a key puzzle the standard model cannot.

    \item \textbf{Key Insight: Endogenous Financial Fragility}\\
    The model reveals a counterintuitive behavioral response: the government is induced to \textbf{borrow more aggressively} to exploit "cheap" credit offered by optimistic lenders. This leads to higher equilibrium debt and makes the economy \textbf{endogenously more fragile}.
